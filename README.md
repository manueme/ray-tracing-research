# Ray Tracing Research

## Introduction

In this project, it is proposed to know more about the possibilities of RT cores for ray tracing development, as well as
their real advantages compared to CPU or GPU development of previous generations. It is also proposed to study the
Artificial Intelligence techniques developed by NVIDIA, and other research groups, for the improvement, denoising, and
acceleration of the generation of images with ray tracing. For this, one or more ray-tracing applications will be
carried out, which may have different objectives: physically realistic ray tracing, real-time ray tracing (with AI-based
denoising), path tracing and other methodologies suitable for daylighting analysis.

## Acknowledgements

* My first steps in Vulkan were possible thanks to [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/).

* The first steps of this project (especially the ray tracing part) were carried out following the demos and examples
  referenced on the [official Khronos website](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan):
    * [Sascha Willems' examples and demos for Vulkan](https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan), IMO the best samples and
      demos of Vulkan out there, now transformed into
      a [Vulkan reference material or framework](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Samples) by Khronos.
    * [NVIDIA DeignWorks Samples](https://github.com/nvpro-samples).

## Status <a href="https://www.repostatus.org/#wip"><img src="https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg" alt="Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public." /></a>

This project is still a work in progress.

## Code style and naming conventions

There's a `.clang-format` and `.clang-tidy` file defined for the project, in order to write code install and configure
on your IDE, **Clangd:** https://clangd.llvm.org/installation.html, or both **Clang-Format** and **Clang-Tidy**.

*Note: you may also want to remove any naming convention settings on your IDE to prevent overriding the clang-tidy
readability checks*

## External Sources

### Vulkan SDK

Download the LunarG SDK from: https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home

### GLFW

#### Windows

Run `build_glfw_windows.bat`

The script will clone (https://github.com/glfw/glfw) and build GLFW. Don't forget to check recent issues on Windows
building if the process fails, you can always checkout to the last stable tag release, for example
[v3.3.2](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/commit/0a49ef0a00baa3ab520ddc452f0e3b1e099c5589)

CMake will take care of the rest, if you change the generator make sure to also update the paths in the GLFW section of
the CMakeLists.txt to target the new libraries

#### Linux

`sudo apt install libglfw3-dev libglfw3`

### GLM

GLM is imported within a git submodule (external_sources/glm), don't forget to initialize it.

### FreeImage

#### Windows

1- Download the **Binary distribution** from http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/.

2- Copy the **Dist** folder to `external_sources` and rename it to `freeImage`, the `x32` and `x64` folders with
the `FreeImage.dll`, `FreeImage.h` and `FreeImage.lib` files must be directly under `freeImage` _(
/external_sources/freeImage/...)_

Note: for this project v3.18.0 was used

TODO: Make a script to take care of this process

#### Linux

Install FreeImage from repository package:

`sudo apt-get install libfreeimage-dev`

### Assimp

#### Windows

Run `build_assimp_windows.bat`

The script will clone (https://github.com/assimp/assimp) and build Assimp. Don't forget to check recent issues on
Windows building if the process fails, you can always checkout to the last stable tag release, for example
[v5.0.1](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/commit/8f0c6b04b2257a520aaab38421b2e090204b69df)

CMake will take care of the rest, if you change the generator make sure to also update the paths in the Assimp section
of the CMakeLists.txt to target the new libraries

#### Linux

Install Assimp from repository package

`sudo apt-get install libassimp-dev assimp-utils`
